**Documentation:** A comma separated list of postprocessor objects that should be run at the end of each time step. Some of these postprocessors will declare their own parameters which may, for example, include that they will actually do something only every so many time steps or years. Alternatively, the text &lsquo;all&rsquo; indicates that all available postprocessors should be run after each time step.

The following postprocessors are available:

&lsquo;ODE statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about ODEs solved during the model evolution, specifically, how many iterations are needed to solve these ODEs on average.

&lsquo;Stokes residual&rsquo;: A postprocessor that outputs the Stokes residuals during the iterative solver algorithm into a file stokes_residuals.txt in the output directory.

&lsquo;basic statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that outputs some simplified statistics like the Rayleigh number and other quantities that only make sense in certain model setups. The output is written after completing initial adaptive refinement steps. The postprocessor assumes a point at the surface at the adiabatic surface temperature and pressure is a reasonable reference condition for computing these properties. Furthermore, the Rayleigh number is computed using the model depth (i.e. not the radius of the Earth), as we need a definition that is geometry independent. Take care when comparing these values to published studies and make sure they use the same definitions.

&lsquo;boundary densities&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes the laterally averaged density at the top and bottom of the domain.

&lsquo;boundary pressures&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes the laterally averaged pressure at the top and bottom of the domain.

&lsquo;boundary strain rate residual statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the surface strain rate residual along the top boundary. The residual is the difference between the second invariant of the model strain rate and the second strain rate invariant read from the input data file. Currently, the strain residual statistics, i.e., min, max and the rms magnitude, are computed at the top surface.

&lsquo;boundary velocity residual statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the velocity residual along the top boundary. The velocity residual is the difference between the model solution velocities and the input velocities (GPlates model or ascii data). Currently, the velocity residual statistics, i.e., min, max and the rms magnitude, is computed at the top surface.

&lsquo;command&rsquo;: A postprocessor that executes a command line process.

&lsquo;composition statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the compositional fields, if present in this simulation. In particular, it computes maximal and minimal values of each field, as well as the total mass contained in this field as defined by the integral $m_i(t) = \int_\Omega c_i(\mathbf x,t) \; \text{d}x$.

&lsquo;composition velocity statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes the root mean square velocity over the area spanned by each compositional field (i.e. where the field values are larger or equal to 0.5.

&lsquo;core statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the core evolution. (Working only with dynamic core boundary temperature plugin)

&lsquo;crystal preferred orientation&rsquo;: A Postprocessor that writes out CPO specific particle data. It can write out the CPO data as it is stored (raw) and/or as a random draw volume weighted representation. The latter one is recommended for plotting against real data. For both representations the specific output fields and their order can be set. The work of this postprocessor should better be done by the main particles postprocessor, however we need to be able to process the data before outputting it, which does not work with that postprocessor. If this is added to the other postprocessor in the future this one becomes obsolete.

&lsquo;current surface&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes a function of the surface that includes the mesh deformation. This postprocessor has a function that can be called from other plugins to get the depth.

&lsquo;depth average&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes depth averaged quantities and writes them into a file <depth_average.ext> in the output directory, where the extension of the file is determined by the output format you select. In addition to the output format, a number of other parameters also influence this postprocessor, and they can be set in the section `Postprocess/Depth average` in the input file.

In the output files, the $x$-value of each data point corresponds to the depth, whereas the $y$-value corresponds to the simulation time. The time is provided in seconds or, if the global &ldquo;Use years instead of seconds&rdquo; parameter is set, in years.

&lsquo;domain volume statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes the total area (in 2d) or volume (in 3d) of the computational domain.

&lsquo;dynamic topography&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes a measure of dynamic topography based on the stress at the boundary. The data is written into text files named &lsquo;dynamic\_topography_\X.NNNNN&rsquo; in the output directory, where X is the name of the boundary and NNNNN is the number of the time step.

The exact approach works as follows: At each selected boundary, we compute the traction that acts normal to the boundary faces using the consistent boundary flux method as described in &ldquo;Gresho, Lee, Sani, Maslanik, Eaton (1987). The consistent Galerkin FEM for computing derived boundary quantities in thermal and or fluids problems. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids, 7(4), 371-394.&rdquo; From this traction, the dynamic topography is computed using the formula $h=\frac{\sigma_{n}}{g \rho}$ where $g$ is the norm of the gravity and $\rho$ is the density. For the bottom surface we chose the convention that positive values are up and negative values are down, analogous to the deformation of the upper surface. Note that this implementation takes the direction of gravity into account, which means that reversing the flow in backward advection calculations will not reverse the instantaneous topography because the reverse flow will be divided by the reverse surface gravity.
The file format then consists of lines with Euclidean coordinates followed by the corresponding topography value.

&lsquo;entropy statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes the number of iterations used for equilibrating temperature when using the entropy material model with multiple components. It returns an average of iterations performed for every time step during the model evolution.

&lsquo;entropy viscosity statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes the maximum and volume averagedentropy viscosity stabilization for the temperature field.

&lsquo;fluid velocity statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes the maximum fluid velocity in the computational domain. The fluid velocity is either the melt velocity or the Darcy velocity depending on the advection method chosen for the porosity compositional field.

&lsquo;geoid&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes a representation of the geoid based on the density structure in the mantle, as well as the topography at the surface and core mantle boundary (CMB) if desired. The topography is based on the dynamic topography postprocessor in case of no free surface, and based on the real surface from the geometry model in case of a free surface. The geoid is computed from a spherical harmonic expansion, so the geometry of the domain must be a 3d spherical shell.

&lsquo;global statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that outputs all the global statistics information, e.g. the time of the simulation, the timestep number, number of degrees of freedom and solver iterations for each timestep. The postprocessor can output different formats, the first printing one line in the statistics file per nonlinear solver iteration (if a nonlinear solver scheme is selected). The second prints one line per timestep, summing the information about all nonlinear iterations in this line. Note that this postprocessor is always active independent on whether or not it is selected in the parameter file.

&lsquo;gravity calculation&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes gravity, gravity anomalies, gravity potential and gravity gradients for a set of points (e.g. satellites) in or above the model surface for either a user-defined range of latitudes, longitudes and radius or a list of point coordinates.Spherical coordinates in the output file are radius, colatitude and colongitude. Gravity is here based on the density distribution from the material model (and non adiabatic). This means that the density may come directly from an ascii file. This postprocessor also computes theoretical gravity and its derivatives, which corresponds to the analytical solution of gravity in the same geometry but filled with a reference density. The reference density is also used to determine density anomalies for computing gravity anomalies. Thus one must carefully evaluate the meaning of the gravity anomaly output, because the solution may not reflect the actual gravity anomaly (due to differences in the assumed reference density). On way to guarantee correct gravity anomalies is to subtract gravity of a certain point from the average gravity on the map. Another way is to directly use density anomalies for this postprocessor.The average- minimum- and maximum gravity acceleration and potential are written into the statistics file.

&lsquo;heat flux densities&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the heat flux density for each boundary id. The heat flux density across each boundary is computed in outward direction, i.e., from the domain to the outside. The heat flux is computed as sum of advective heat flux and conductive heat flux through Neumann boundaries, both computed as integral over the boundary area, and conductive heat flux through Dirichlet boundaries, which is computed using the consistent boundary flux method as described in &ldquo;Gresho, Lee, Sani, Maslanik, Eaton (1987). The consistent Galerkin FEM for computing derived boundary quantities in thermal and or fluids problems. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids, 7(4), 371-394.&rdquo;

Note that the &ldquo;heat flux statistics&rdquo; postprocessor computes the same quantity as the one here, but not divided by the area of the surface. In other words, it computes the *total* heat flux through each boundary.

&lsquo;heat flux map&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes the heat flux density across each boundary in outward direction, i.e., from the domain to the outside. The heat flux is computed as sum of advective heat flux and conductive heat flux through Neumann boundaries, both computed as integral over the boundary area, and conductive heat flux through Dirichlet boundaries, which is computed using the consistent boundary flux method as described in &ldquo;Gresho, Lee, Sani, Maslanik, Eaton (1987). The consistent Galerkin FEM for computing derived boundary quantities in thermal and or fluids problems. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids, 7(4), 371-394.&rdquo;

&lsquo;heat flux statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the heat flux density across each boundary in outward direction, i.e., from the domain to the outside. The heat flux is computed as sum of advective heat flux and conductive heat flux through Neumann boundaries, both computed as integral over the boundary area, and conductive heat flux through Dirichlet boundaries, which is computed using the consistent boundary flux method as described in &ldquo;Gresho, Lee, Sani, Maslanik, Eaton (1987). The consistent Galerkin FEM for computing derived boundary quantities in thermal and or fluids problems. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids, 7(4), 371-394.&rdquo;The point-wise heat flux can be obtained from the heat flux map postprocessor, which outputs the heat flux to a file, or the heat flux map visualization postprocessor, which outputs the heat flux for visualization.

As stated, this postprocessor computes the *outbound* heat flux. If you are interested in the opposite direction, for example from the core into the mantle when the domain describes the mantle, then you need to multiply the result by -1.

:::{note}
In geodynamics, the term &ldquo;heat flux&rdquo; is often understood to be the quantity $- k \nabla T$, which is really a heat flux *density*, i.e., a vector-valued field. In contrast to this, the current postprocessor only computes the integrated flux over each part of the boundary. Consequently, the units of the quantity computed here are $W=\frac{J}{s}$.
:::

The &ldquo;heat flux densities&rdquo; postprocessor computes the same quantity as the one here, but divided by the area of the surface.

&lsquo;heating statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about heating, averaged by volume.

&lsquo;load balance statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes statistics about the distribution of cells, and if present particles across subdomains. In particular, it computes maximal, average and minimal number of cells across all ranks. If there are particles it also computes the maximal, average, and minimum number of particles across all ranks, and maximal, average, and minimal ratio between local number of particles and local number of cells across all processes. All of these numbers can be useful to assess the load balance between different MPI ranks, as the difference between the minimal and maximal load should be as small as possible.

&lsquo;mass flux statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the mass flux across boundaries. For each boundary indicator (see your geometry description for which boundary indicators are used), the mass flux is computed in outward direction, i.e., from the domain to the outside, using the formula $\int_{\Gamma_i} \rho \mathbf v \cdot \mathbf n$ where $\Gamma_i$ is the part of the boundary with indicator $i$, $\rho$ is the density as reported by the material model, $\mathbf v$ is the velocity, and $\mathbf n$ is the outward normal.

As stated, this postprocessor computes the *outbound* mass flux. If you are interested in the opposite direction, for example from the core into the mantle when the domain describes the mantle, then you need to multiply the result by -1.

:::{note}
In geodynamics, the term &ldquo;mass flux&rdquo; is often understood to be the quantity $\rho \mathbf v$, which is really a mass flux *density*, i.e., a vector-valued field. In contrast to this, the current postprocessor only computes the integrated flux over each part of the boundary. Consequently, the units of the quantity computed here are $\frac{kg}{s}$.
:::

&lsquo;material statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the material properties. In particular, it computes the volume-averages of the density and viscosity, and the total mass in the model. Specifically, it implements the following formulas in each time step: $\left<\rho\right> = \frac{1}{|\Omega|} \int_\Omega \rho(\mathbf x) \, \text{d}x$, $\left<\eta\right> = \frac{1}{|\Omega|} \int_\Omega \eta(\mathbf x) \, \text{d}x$, $M = \int_\Omega \rho(\mathbf x) \, \text{d}x$, where $|\Omega|$ is the volume of the domain.

&lsquo;matrix statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the matrices. In particular, it outputs total memory consumption, total non-zero elements, and non-zero elements per block, for system matrix and system preconditioner matrix.

&lsquo;maximum depth of field&rsquo;: A postprocessor that for each compositional field outputs the largest depth at which a quadrature point is found where the field has a value of 0.5 or larger. For fields that do not represent materials, but for example track a certain quantity like strain, this value of 0.5 does not necessarily make sense.

&lsquo;melt statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the melt (volume) fraction. If the material model does not implement a melt fraction function, the output is set to zero.

&lsquo;memory statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the memory consumption. In particular, it computes the memory usage of the system matrix, triangulation, p4est, DoFHandler, current constraints, solution vector, and peak virtual memory usage, all in MB. It also outputs the memory usage of the system matrix to the screen.

&lsquo;mobility statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about mobility following Tackley (2000) and Lourenco et al. (2020).

&lsquo;particle count statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the particle distribution, if present in this simulation. In particular, it computes minimal, average and maximal values of particles per cell in the global domain.

&lsquo;particle distribution score&rsquo;: This postprocessor is intended to help evaluate how much the density of particles varies within cells, with the goal of supporting the development of algorithms to select particles for deletion and addition during load balancing. Because particle deletion can happen in various ways when load balancing, there are times when unintended gradients of particle density can form, especially when particles are moving from more refined cells into coarser cells. The postprocessor calculates a value from 0 to 1 for every cell, with values closer to zero representing cells with a density which is more uniform across the cell&rsquo;s area and values closer to 1 representing a cell in which the particles are highly concentrated in one part of the cell. Essentially, the postprocessor is trying to describe numerically how much particle density varies within cells. It does this by sorting every particle in each cell into a bucket based on the particle&rsquo;s location, and comparing the resulting data structure to ideal and worst case versions.

&lsquo;particle distribution statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the particle distribution within grid cells. In particular it calculates a point-density function for every cell and derives the maximum, minimum, and standard deviation values for every cell. The postprocessor reports the average of these values from every cell. It also reports the absolute maximum and minimum values across all cells. These sorts of statistics are useful to determine whether schemes that move, add, remove, or otherwise change the number of particles associated with each cell result in a roughly uniform distribution of particles in each cell, or whether particles tend to cluster in some parts of cells leaving other parts mostly empty. For example, comparing the maximum standard deviations of different load balancing schemes applied to a given test case illuminates which load balancing method creates more clustered particles. The maximum and minimum values of these point-density functions are also useful in the same way. These statistical values are computed from the point-density function and make up a quantitative description of particle clustering which is intended to supplement qualitative descriptions of particle clustering. The goal behind describing particle clustering numerically is to assist in developing new methods to add and delete particles which maintain roughly uniform particle density within cells.

&lsquo;particles&rsquo;: A Postprocessor that creates particles that follow the velocity field of the simulation. The particles can be generated and propagated in various ways and they can carry a number of constant or time-varying properties. The postprocessor can write output positions and properties of all particles at chosen intervals, although this is not mandatory. It also allows other parts of the code to query the particles for information.

&lsquo;point values&rsquo;: A postprocessor that evaluates the solution (i.e., velocity, pressure, temperature, and compositional fields along with other fields that are treated as primary variables) at the end of every time step or after a user-specified time interval at a given set of points and then writes this data into the file <point\_values.txt> in the output directory. The points at which the solution should be evaluated are specified in the section `Postprocess/Point values` in the input file.

In the output file, data is organized as (i) time, (ii) the 2 or 3 coordinates of the evaluation points, and (iii) followed by the values of the solution vector at this point. The time is provided in seconds or, if the global &ldquo;Use years instead of seconds&rdquo; parameter is set, in years. In the latter case, the velocity is also converted to meters/year, instead of meters/second.

:::{note}
Evaluating the solution of a finite element field at arbitrarily chosen points is an expensive process. Using this postprocessor will only be efficient if the number of evaluation points or output times is relatively small. If you need a very large number of evaluation points, you should consider extracting this information from the visualization program you use to display the output of the &lsquo;visualization&rsquo; postprocessor.
:::

&lsquo;pressure statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the pressure field.

&lsquo;rotation statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the rotational velocity of the model (i.e. integrated net rotation and angular momentum). In 2d we assume the model to be a cross-section through an infinite domain in z direction, with a zero z-velocity. Thus, the z-axis is the only possible rotation axis and both moment of inertia and angular momentum are scalar instead of tensor quantities.

&lsquo;sea level&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes the sea level for glacial isostatic adjustmentmodeling. When ice melts and enters the ocean, the ocean water needs to beredistributed in a gravitationally consistent way. With the updated surfaceloading (ocean and ice) the free surface deformation needs to be computediteratively before moving to the next time step. A postprocessor intended for use with a deforming top surface. After every step it computes the sea level based on the topography, ocean basin, ice melt, perturbed gravitational potential of the Earth model and gravitational potential of the ice load, relative to a reference datum (initial radius for a spherical shell geometry model). The sea level computation is based on {cite}`Martinec2018`. If the parameter &rsquo;Output to file&rsquo; in subsection &rsquo;Postprocess/Sea level&rsquo; (that is, the subsection corresponding to the current postprocessor) is set to true, this postprocessor also outputs sea level into text files named &lsquo;sea_level.NNNNN&rsquo; in the output directory, where NNNNN is the number of the time step.

The file format then consists of lines with Euclidean coordinates followed by the corresponding sea level value. Sea level is printed/written in meters.

&lsquo;spherical velocity statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes radial, tangential and total RMS velocity.

&lsquo;temperature statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the temperature field.

&lsquo;timing statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that outputs timing information in the statistics file, in particular the total wall time spent in the different timing sections until the current timestep. Note that this postprocessor cannot report accurate timings for the postprocessing section as it is executed before postprocessing is complete.

&lsquo;topography&rsquo;: A postprocessor intended for use with a deforming top surface.  After every step it loops over all the vertices on the top surface and determines the maximum and minimum topography relative to a reference datum (initial box height for a box geometry model or initial radius for a sphere/spherical shell geometry model). If the parameter &rsquo;Output to file&rsquo; in subsection &rsquo;Postprocess/Topography&rsquo; (that is, the subsection corresponding to the current postprocessor) is set to true, this postprocessor also outputs topography into text files named &lsquo;topography.NNNNN&rsquo; in the output directory, where NNNNN is the number of the time step.
The file format then consists of lines with Euclidean coordinates followed by the corresponding topography value.Topography is printed/written in meters.

It is worth comparing this postprocessor with the visualization postprocessor called &ldquo;surface elevation&rdquo;. The latter is used to *visualize* the surface elevation in graphical form, by outputting it into the same files that the solution and other postprocessed variables are written, to then be used for visualization using programs such as VisIt or Paraview. In contrast, the current postprocessor generates the same *kind* of information, but instead writes it as a point cloud that can then more easily be processed using tools other than visualization programs.

&lsquo;velocity boundary statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the velocity along the boundaries. For each boundary indicator (see your geometry description for which boundary indicators are used), the min and max velocity magnitude is computed.

&lsquo;velocity statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes the root mean square and maximum velocity in the computational domain.

&lsquo;viscous dissipation statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that outputs the viscous rate of dissipation of energy for each compositional field (where the field has a value of 0.5 or more) as well as over the whole domain. When all the fields represent lithologies and there is no background field, the sum of the individual field&rsquo;s dissipation should equal that over the whole domain. The viscous dissipation is computed as: $\int_{V}\left(\sigma^\prime \dot{\epsilon}^\prime \right)$, where $\sigma^\prime$  is the deviatoric stress and $\dot{\epsilon}^\prime$ the deviatoric strain rate.Note then when shear heating is included in the temperature equation, it is better to use the &rsquo;heating statistics&rsquo; postprocessor.

&lsquo;visualization&rsquo;: A postprocessor that takes the solution and writes it into files that can be read by a graphical visualization program. Additional run time parameters are read from the parameter subsection &rsquo;Visualization&rsquo;.

&lsquo;volume of fluid statistics&rsquo;: A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the volume-of-fluid fields.

This is a second-order symmetric tensor with 6 components in 3d. In 2d this option has no effect, because the rotation axis is fixed and thus the moment of inertia is always a scalar.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Filter_20output)=
### __Parameter name:__ Filter output
**Default value:** false

**Pattern:** [Bool]

**Documentation:** deal.II offers the possibility to filter duplicate vertices for HDF5 output files. This merges the vertices of adjacent cells and therefore saves disk space, but misrepresents discontinuous output properties. Activating this function reduces the disk space by about a factor of $2^{dim}$ for HDF5 output, and currently has no effect on other output formats.
 :::{warning}
Setting this flag to true will result in visualization output that does not accurately represent discontinuous fields. This may be because you are using a discontinuous finite element for the pressure, temperature, or compositional variables, or because you use a visualization postprocessor that outputs quantities as discontinuous fields (e.g., the strain rate, viscosity, etc.). These will then all be visualized as *continuous* quantities even though, internally, ASPECT considers them as discontinuous fields.
:::

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Interpolate_20output)=
### __Parameter name:__ Interpolate output
**Default value:** true

**Pattern:** [Bool]

**Documentation:** deal.II offers the possibility to linearly interpolate output fields of higher order elements to a finer resolution. This somewhat compensates the fact that most visualization software only offers linear interpolation between grid points and therefore the output file is a very coarse representation of the actual solution field. Activating this option increases the spatial resolution in each dimension by a factor equal to the polynomial degree used for the velocity finite element (usually 2). In other words, instead of showing one quadrilateral or hexahedron in the visualization per cell on which ASPECT computes, it shows multiple (for quadratic elements, it will describe each cell of the mesh on which we compute as $2\times 2$ or $2\times 2\times 2$ cells in 2d and 3d, respectively; correspondingly more subdivisions are used if you use cubic, quartic, or even higher order elements for the velocity).

The effect of using this option can be seen in the following picture showing a variation of the output produced with the input files from {ref}`sec:cookbooks:shell_simple_2d`:

\begin{center}  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{viz/parameters/build-patches}\end{center}Here, the left picture shows one visualization cell per computational cell (i.e., the option is switched off), and the right picture shows the same simulation with the option switched on (which is the default). The images show the same data, demonstrating that interpolating the solution onto bilinear shape functions as is commonly done in visualizing data loses information.

Of course, activating this option also greatly increases the amount of data ASPECT will write to disk: approximately by a factor of 4 in 2d, and a factor of 8 in 3d, when using quadratic elements for the velocity, and correspondingly more for even higher order elements.

**Documentation:** A comma separated list of visualization objects that should be run whenever writing graphical output. By default, the graphical output files will always contain the primary variables velocity, pressure, and temperature. However, one frequently wants to also visualize derived quantities, such as the thermodynamic phase that corresponds to a given temperature-pressure value, or the corresponding seismic wave speeds. The visualization objects do exactly this: they compute such derived quantities and place them into the output file. The current parameter is the place where you decide which of these additional output variables you want to have in your output file.

The following postprocessors are available:

&lsquo;ISA rotation timescale&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output showing the timescale for the rotation of grains toward the infinite strain axis. Kaminski and Ribe (see {cite}`Kaminski2002`) call this quantity $\tau_\text{ISA}$ and define it as $\tau_\text{ISA} \approx \frac{1}{\dot{\epsilon}}$ where $\dot{\epsilon}$ is the largest eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor. It can be used, along with the grain lag angle $\Theta$, to calculate the grain orientation lag parameter.

Physical units: $\text{s}$.

&lsquo;Vp anomaly&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output showing the percentage anomaly in the seismic compressional wave speed $V_p$ as a spatially variable function with one value per cell. This anomaly is either shown as a percentage anomaly relative to the reference profile given by adiabatic conditions (with the compositions given by the current composition, such that the reference could potentially change through time), or as a percentage change relative to the laterally averaged velocity at the depth of the cell. This velocity is calculated by linear interpolation between average values calculated within equally thick depth slices. The number of depth slices in the domain is user-defined. Typically, the best results will be obtained if the number of depth slices is balanced between being large enough to capture step changes in velocities, but small enough to maintain a reasonable number of evaluation points per slice. Bear in mind that lateral averaging subsamples the finite element mesh. Note that this plugin requires a material model that provides seismic velocities.

Physical units: None, the quantity being output is a fractional change provided as a percentage.

&lsquo;Vs anomaly&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output showing the percentage anomaly in the seismic shear wave speed $V_s$ as a spatially variable function with one value per cell. This anomaly is either shown as a percentage anomaly relative to the reference profile given by adiabatic conditions (with the compositions given by the current composition, such that the reference could potentially change through time), or as a percentage change relative to the laterally averaged velocity at the depth of the cell. This velocity is calculated by linear interpolation between average values calculated within equally thick depth slices. The number of depth slices in the domain is user-defined. Typically, the best results will be obtained if the number of depth slices is balanced between being large enough to capture step changes in velocities, but small enough to maintain a reasonable number of evaluation points per slice. Bear in mind that lateral averaging subsamples the finite element mesh. Note that this plugin requires a material model that provides seismic velocities.

Physical units: None, the quantity being output is a fractional change provided as a percentage.

&lsquo;adiabat&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates adiabatic temperature, pressure, density, and density derivative (with regard to depth)as produced by the `AdiabaticConditions` class.

Physical units: $\text{K}$, $\text{Pa}$, $\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3\text{m}}$}, respectively, for the four components.

&lsquo;artificial viscosity&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output showing the value of the artificial viscosity on each cell.

Physical units: $\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}\text{K}}$.

&lsquo;artificial viscosity composition&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output showing the value of the artificial viscosity for a compositional field on each cell.

Physical units: $\frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}}$.

&lsquo;boundary indicators&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output about the used boundary indicators. In a loop over the active cells, if a cell lies at a domain boundary, the boundary indicator of the face along the boundary is requested. In case the cell does not lie along any domain boundary, the cell is assigned the value of the largest used boundary indicator plus one. When a cell is situated in one of the corners of the domain, multiple faces will have a boundary indicator. This postprocessor returns the value of the first face along a boundary that is encountered in a loop over all the faces.

Physical units: None.

&lsquo;boundary strain rate residual&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the strain rate residual at the top surface. The residual is computed at each point at the surface as the difference between the strain rate invariant in the model and the input data, where the invariant is computed like in the &rsquo;strain rate&rsquo; postprocessor. The user chooses the input data as ascii data files with coordinate columns and column corresponding to the surface strain rate norm.

Physical units: $\frac{1}{\text{s}}$ or $\frac{1}{\text{year}}$, depending on settings in the input file.

&lsquo;boundary velocity residual&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the velocity residual at the top surface. The residual is computed at each point at the surface as the difference between the modeled velocities and the input data velocities for each vector component. The user has an option to choose the input data as ascii data files (e.g. GPS velocities) with columns in the same format as described for the &rsquo;ascii data&rsquo; initial temperature plugin or a velocity field computed from the GPlates program as described in the gplates boundary velocity plugin.

Physical units: $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$ or $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{year}}$, depending on settings in the input file.

&lsquo;compositional vector&rsquo;: A visualization output object that outputs vectors whose components are derived from compositional fields. Input parameters for this postprocessor are defined in section Postprocess/Visualization/Compositional fields as vectors.

Physical units: None.

&lsquo;darcy velocity&rsquo;: A visualization output object that outputs the Darcy velocity vector. This postprocessor requires a compositional field named &rsquo;porosity&rsquo;.

Physical units: $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$ or $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{year}}$, depending on settings in the input file.

&lsquo;density anomaly&rsquo;: A visualization output postprocessor that outputs the density minus the depth-average of the density.In the &ldquo;lateral average&rdquo; scheme, the average density is calculated using the lateral averaging functionfrom the &ldquo;depth average&rdquo; postprocessor and interpolated linearly between the layers specified through &ldquo;Number of depth slices&rdquo;. In the &ldquo;reference profile&rdquo; scheme, the adiabatic density is used as theaverage density.

Physical units: \si{\kg/m^3}.

&lsquo;depth&rsquo;: A visualization output postprocessor that outputs the depth for all points inside the domain, as determined by the geometry model.

It is worth comparing this visualization postprocessor with the one called &ldquo;surface elevation&rdquo;. The current one is used to visualize a volume variable, whereas the latter only outputs information on the surface. Moreover &ldquo;depth&rdquo; is based on a member function of the geometry models that is documented as never returning a number less than zero -- in other words, it returns the depth of an evaluation point with regard to a reference surface that defines a zero depth, but for points that lie above this reference surface, it returns zero. As a consequence, it cannot be used to visualize positive elevations, whereas the the one called &ldquo;surface elevation&rdquo; can.

Physical units: $\text{m}$.

&lsquo;depth including mesh deformation&rsquo;: A visualization output postprocessor that outputs the depth for all points inside the domain, as determined by the current model surface. This plugin will include changes to the surface from mesh deformation.

Physical units: \si{\meter}.

&lsquo;dynamic topography&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the dynamic topography at the top and bottom of the model space. The actual computation of this topography is handled inside the &rsquo;dynamic topography&rsquo; postprocessor, please check its documentation for details about the numerical methods.

Strictly speaking, the dynamic topography is of course a quantity that is only of interest at the surface. However, we compute it everywhere to make things fit into the framework within which we produce data for visualization. You probably only want to visualize whatever data this postprocessor generates at the surface of your domain and simply ignore the rest of the data generated.

Alternatively, consider using the "surface dynamic topography" visualization postprocessor to only output the dynamic topography at the boundary of the domain.

Physical units: $\text{m}$.

&lsquo;entropy average&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the averaged entropy of multiple components.

Physical units: \si{\J/kg/K}.

&lsquo;error indicator&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output showing the estimated error or other mesh refinement indicator as a spatially variable function with one value per cell.

Physical units: None. (Strictly speaking, errors have physical units of course, but because error *indicators* can be computed from different solution components and other input, we consider error indicators unitless.)

&lsquo;geoid&rsquo;: Visualization for the geoid solution. The geoid is given by the equivalent water column height due to a gravity perturbation.

Physical units: $\text{m}$.

&lsquo;grain lag angle&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output showing the angle between the ~infinite strain axis and the flow velocity. Kaminski and Ribe (see {cite}`Kaminski2002`) call this quantity $\Theta$ and define it as $\Theta = \cos^{-1}(\hat{u}\cdot\hat{e})$  where $\hat{u}=\vec{u}/|{u}|$, $\vec{u}$ is the local flow velocity, and $\hat{e}$ is the local infinite strain axis, which we calculate as the first eigenvector of the &rsquo;left stretch&rsquo; tensor. $\Theta$ can be used to calculate the grain orientation lag parameter.

Physical units: $\text{radian}$.

&lsquo;gravity&rsquo;: A visualization output object that outputs the gravity vector.

Physical units: $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$.

&lsquo;heat flux map&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the heat flux density across the top and bottom boundary in outward direction. The heat flux is computed as sum of advective heat flux and conductive heat flux through Neumann boundaries, both computed as integral over the boundary area, and conductive heat flux through Dirichlet boundaries, which is computed using the consistent boundary flux method as described in &ldquo;Gresho, Lee, Sani, Maslanik, Eaton (1987). The consistent Galerkin FEM for computing derived boundary quantities in thermal and or fluids problems. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids, 7(4), 371-394.&rdquo; If only conductive heat flux through Dirichlet boundaries is of interest, the postprocessor can produce output of higher resolution by evaluating the CBF solution vector point-wise instead of computing cell-wise averaged values.

Physical units: $\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^2}$.

&lsquo;heating&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for all the heating terms used in the energy equation.

Physical units: $\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^3}$\si{\watt\per\cubic\meter}.

&lsquo;material properties&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the material properties given by the material model. The current postprocessor allows to output a (potentially large) subset of all of the information provided by material models at once, with just a single material model evaluation per output point. Although individual properties can still be listed in the &ldquo;List of output variables&rdquo;, this visualization plugin is called internally to avoid duplicated evaluations of the material model.

In almost all places inside ASPECT, the program can use &ldquo;averaged&rdquo; material properties, for example for the assembly of matrices and right hand side vectors. To accurately reflect the material parameters used internally, this visualization postprocessor averages in the same way as is used to do the assembly, and consequently the graphical output will reflect not pointwise properties, but averaged properties.

Physical units: Various.

&lsquo;maximum horizontal compressive stress&rsquo;: A plugin that computes the direction and magnitude of the maximum horizontal component of the compressive stress as a vector field. The direction of this vector can often be used to visualize the principal mode of deformation (e.g., at normal faults or extensional margins) and can be correlated with seismic anisotropy. Recall that the *compressive* stress is simply the negative stress, $\sigma_c=-\sigma=-\left[     2\eta (\varepsilon(\mathbf u)             - \frac 13 (\nabla \cdot \mathbf u) I)     + pI\right]$.

Following {cite}`LundTownend07`, we define the maximum horizontal stress direction as that *horizontal* direction $\mathbf n$ that maximizes $\mathbf n^T \sigma_c \mathbf n$. We call a vector *horizontal* if it is perpendicular to the gravity vector $\mathbf g$.

In two space dimensions, $\mathbf n$ is simply a vector that is horizontal (we choose one of the two possible choices). This direction is then scaled by the size of the horizontal stress in this direction, i.e., the plugin outputs the vector $\mathbf w = (\mathbf n^T \sigma_c \mathbf n) \; \mathbf n$.

In three space dimensions, given two horizontal, perpendicular, unit length, but otherwise arbitrarily chosen vectors $\mathbf u,\mathbf v$, we can express $\mathbf n = (\cos \alpha)\mathbf u + (\sin\alpha)\mathbf v$ where $\alpha$ maximizes the expression $\begin{align*}  f(\alpha) = \mathbf n^T \sigma_c \mathbf n  = (\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf u)(\cos\alpha)^2    +2(\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf v)(\cos\alpha)(\sin\alpha)    +(\mathbf v^T \sigma_c \mathbf v)(\sin\alpha)^2.\end{align*}$

The maximum of $f(\alpha)$ is attained where $f^\prime(\alpha)=0$. Evaluating the derivative and using trigonometric identities, one finds that $\alpha$ has to satisfy the equation $\begin{align*}  \tan(2\alpha) = \frac{2.0\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf v}                          {\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf u                            - \mathbf v^T \sigma_c \mathbf v}.\end{align*}$Since the transform $\alpha\mapsto\alpha+\pi$ flips the direction of $\mathbf n$, we only need to seek a solution to this equation in the interval $\alpha\in[0,\pi)$. These are given by $\alpha_1=\frac 12 \arctan \frac{\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf v}{\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf u - \mathbf v^T \sigma_c \mathbf v}$ and $\alpha_2=\alpha_1+\frac{\pi}{2}$, one of which will correspond to a minimum and the other to a maximum of $f(\alpha)$. One checks the sign of $f^{\prime\prime}(\alpha)=-2(\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf u - \mathbf v^T \sigma_c \mathbf v)\cos(2\alpha) - 2 (\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf v) \sin(2\alpha)$ for each of these to determine the $\alpha$ that maximizes $f(\alpha)$, and from this immediately arrives at the correct form for the maximum horizontal stress $\mathbf n$.

The description above computes a 3d *direction* vector $\mathbf n$. If one were to scale this vector the same way as done in 2d, i.e., with the magnitude of the stress in this direction, one will typically get vectors whose length is principally determined by the hydrostatic pressure at a given location simply because the hydrostatic pressure is the largest component of the overall stress. On the other hand, the hydrostatic pressure does not determine any principal direction because it is an isotropic, anti-compressive force. As a consequence, there are often points in simulations (e.g., at the center of convection rolls) where the stress has no dominant horizontal direction, and the algorithm above will then in essence choose a random direction because the stress is approximately equal in all horizontal directions. If one scaled the output by the magnitude of the stress in this direction (i.e., approximately equal to the hydrostatic pressure at this point), one would get randomly oriented vectors at these locations with significant lengths.

To avoid this problem, we scale the maximal horizontal compressive stress direction $\mathbf n$ by the *difference* between the stress in the maximal and minimal horizontal stress directions. In other words, let $\mathbf n_\perp=(\sin \alpha)\mathbf u - (\cos\alpha)\mathbf v$ be the horizontal direction perpendicular to $\mathbf n$, then this plugin outputs the vector quantity $\mathbf w = (\mathbf n^T \sigma_c \mathbf n                -\mathbf n^T_\perp \sigma_c \mathbf n_\perp)               \; \mathbf n$. In other words, the length of the vector produced indicates *how dominant* the direction of maximal horizontal compressive strength is.

Fig.~\ref{fig:max-horizontal-compressive-stress} shows a simple example for this kind of visualization in 3d.

\begin{figure}  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]    {viz/plugins/maximum_horizontal_compressive_stress/temperature.png}  \hfill  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]    {viz/plugins/maximum_horizontal_compressive_stress/velocity.png}  \hfill  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]    {viz/plugins/maximum_horizontal_compressive_stress/horizontal-stress.png}  \caption{\it Illustration of the &lsquo;maximum horizontal     compressive stress&rsquo; visualization plugin. The left     figure shows a ridge-like temperature anomaly. Together     with no-slip boundary along all six boundaries, this     results in two convection rolls (center). The maximal     horizontal compressive strength at the bottom center     of the domain is perpendicular to the ridge because     the flow comes together there from the left and right,     yielding a compressive force in left-right direction.     At the top of the model, the flow separates outward,     leading to a *negative* compressive stress     in left-right direction; because there is no flow     in front-back direction, the compressive strength     in front-back direction is zero, making the along-ridge     direction the dominant one. At the center of the     convection rolls, both horizontal directions yield     the same stress; the plugin therefore chooses an     essentially arbitrary horizontal vector, but then     uses a zero magnitude given that the difference     between the maximal and minimal horizontal stress     is zero at these points.}  \label{fig:max-horizontal-compressive-stress}\end{figure}

Note that this plugin does not take into account elastic stresses and therefore cannot be used when elasticity is switched on.

Physical units: $\text{Pa}$.

&lsquo;melt fraction&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the melt fraction at the temperature and pressure of the current point. If the material model computes a melt fraction, this is the quantity that will be visualized. Otherwise, a specific parametrization for batch melting (as described in the following) will be used. It does not take into account latent heat. If there are no compositional fields, or no fields called &rsquo;pyroxenite&rsquo;,  this postprocessor will visualize the melt fraction of peridotite (calculated using the anhydrous model of Katz, 2003). If there is a compositional field called &rsquo;pyroxenite&rsquo;, the postprocessor assumes that this compositional field is the content of pyroxenite, and will visualize the melt fraction for a mixture of peridotite and pyroxenite (using the melting model of Sobolev, 2011 for pyroxenite). All the parameters that were used in these calculations can be changed in the input file, the most relevant maybe being the mass fraction of Cpx in peridotite in the Katz melting model (Mass fraction cpx), which right now has a default of 15\%. The corresponding $p$-$T$-diagrams can be generated by running the tests melt\_postprocessor\_peridotite and melt\_postprocessor\_pyroxenite.

Physical units: None.

&lsquo;melt material properties&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for melt related properties of the material model. Note that this postprocessor always outputs the compaction pressure, but can output a large range of additional properties, as selected in the &ldquo;List of properties&rdquo; parameter.

Physical units: Various, depending on what is being output.

&lsquo;named additional outputs&rsquo;: Some material models can compute quantities other than those that typically appear in the equations that ASPECT solves (such as the viscosity, density, etc). Examples of quantities material models may be able to compute are seismic velocities, or other quantities that can be derived from the state variables and the material coefficients such as the stress or stress anisotropies. These quantities are generically referred to as &lsquo;named outputs&rsquo; because they are given an explicit name different from the usual outputs of material models.

This visualization postprocessor outputs whatever quantities the material model can compute. What quantities these are is specific to the material model in use for a simulation, and for many models in fact does not contain any named outputs at all.

Physical units: Various, depending on what is being output.

&lsquo;nonadiabatic pressure&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the non-adiabatic component of the pressure.

The variable that is outputted this way is computed by taking the pressure at each point and subtracting from it the adiabatic pressure computed at the beginning of the simulation. Because the adiabatic pressure is one way of defining a static pressure background field, what this visualization postprocessor therefore produces is *one* way to compute a *dynamic pressure*. There are, however, other ways as well, depending on the choice of the &ldquo;background pressure&rdquo;.

Physical units: $\text{Pa}$.

&lsquo;nonadiabatic temperature&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the non-adiabatic component of the temperature.

Physical units: $\text{K}$.

&lsquo;particle count&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output about the number of particles per cell.

Physical units: None.

&lsquo;partition&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the parallel partition that every cell of the mesh is associated with.

Physical units: None.

&lsquo;principal stress&rsquo;: A visualization output object that outputs the principal stresses and directions, i.e., the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stress tensor. Wikipedia defines principal stresses as follows: At every point in a stressed body there are at least three planes, called principal planes, with normal vectors, called principal directions, where the corresponding stress vector is perpendicular to the plane, and where there are no normal shear stresses. The three stresses normal to these principal planes are called principal stresses. This postprocessor can either operate on the full stress tensor or only on the deviatoric stress tensor, depending on what run-time parameters are set.

Physical units: $\text{Pa}$.

&lsquo;shear stress&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the 3 (in 2d) or 6 (in 3d) components of the shear stress tensor, i.e., for the components of the tensor $-2\eta\varepsilon(\mathbf u)$ in the incompressible case and $-2\eta\left[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I\right]$ in the compressible case. If elasticity is used, the elastic contribution is being accounted for. The shear stress differs from the full stress tensor by the absence of the pressure. Note that the convention of positive compressive stress is followed.

Physical units: $\text{Pa}$.

&lsquo;spd factor&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the spd factor. The spd factor is a factor which scales a part of the Jacobian used for the Newton solver to make sure that the Jacobian remains positive definite.

Physical units: None.

&lsquo;spherical velocity components&rsquo;: A visualization output object that outputs the polar coordinates components $v_r$ and $v_\phi$ of the velocity field in 2d and the spherical coordinates components $v_r$, $v_{\phi}$ and $v_{\theta}$ of the velocity field in 3d.

Physical units: $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$ or $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{year}}$, depending on settings in the input file.

&lsquo;strain rate&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the norm of the strain rate, i.e., for the quantity $\sqrt{\varepsilon(\mathbf u):\varepsilon(\mathbf u)}$ in the incompressible case and $\sqrt{[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]:[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]}$ in the compressible case. It is also called effective deviatoric strain rate in Glerum et al. (2018).

Physical units: $\frac{1}{\text{s}}$.

&lsquo;strain rate tensor&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the 4 (in 2d) or 9 (in 3d) components of the strain rate tensor, i.e., for the components of the tensor $\varepsilon(\mathbf u)$ in the incompressible case and $\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I$ in the compressible case.

This postprocessor outputs the quantity computed herein as a tensor, i.e., programs such as VisIt or Pararview can visualize it as tensors represented by ellipses, not just as individual fields. That said, you can also visualize individual tensor components, by noting that the components that are written to the output file correspond to the tensor components $t_{xx}, t_{xy}, t_{yx}, t_{yy}$ (in 2d) or  $t_{xx}, t_{xy}, t_{xz}, t_{yx}, t_{yy}, t_{yz}, t_{zx}, t_{zy}, t_{zz}$ (in 3d) of a tensor $t$ in a Cartesian coordinate system. Even though the tensor we output is symmetric, the output contains all components of the tensor because that is what the file format requires.

Physical units: \si{\per\second}.

&lsquo;stress&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the 3 (in 2d) or 6 (in 3d) components of the stress tensor, i.e., for the components of the tensor $-2\eta\varepsilon(\mathbf u)+pI$ in the incompressible case and $-2\eta\left[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I\right]+pI$ in the compressible case. If elasticity is used, the elastic contribution is being accounted for. Note that the convention of positive compressive stress is followed.

Even though the tensor we output is symmetric, the output contains all components of the tensor because that is what the file format requires.

Physical units: $\text{Pa}$.

&lsquo;stress residual&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the difference between the second moment invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor and the yield stress. Note that this plugin currently only works when the &rsquo;visco plastic&rsquo; material model is used.

&lsquo;stress second invariant&rsquo;: A visualization output object that outputs the second moment invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor.

Physical units: $\text{Pa}$.

&lsquo;surface dynamic topography&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the dynamic topography at the top and bottom of the model space. The actual computation of this topography is handled inside the &rsquo;dynamic topography&rsquo; postprocessor, please check its documentation for details about the numerical methods.

In contrast to the &lsquo;dynamic topography&rsquo; visualization postprocessor, this plugin really only evaluates the dynamic topography at faces of cells that are adjacent to &lsquo;bottom&rsquo; and &lsquo;top&rsquo; boundaries, and only outputs information on the surface of the domain, rather than padding the information with zeros in the interior of the domain.

Physical units: $\text{m}$.

&lsquo;surface elevation&rsquo;: This postprocessor is used to visualize the elevation of points on the surface of the geometry relative to a &ldquo;reference elevation&rdquo; defined by an undeformed geometry. It can be used, for example, to visualize an initial topography field, as well as the result of dynamic surface deformation due to a free surface.

The surface elevation is computed only for those parts of the boundary that the geometry description marks as &ldquo;top&rdquo;. On all other parts of the boundary, the class outputs a zero elevation.

It is worth comparing this visualization postprocessor with the one called &ldquo;depth&rdquo;. The latter is used to visualize a volume variable, whereas the current one only outputs information on the surface. Moreover &ldquo;depth&rdquo; is based on a member function of the geometry models that is documented as never returning a number less than zero -- in other words, it returns the depth of an evaluation point with regard to a reference surface that defines a zero depth, but for points that lie above this reference surface, it returns zero. As a consequence, it cannot be used to visualize positive elevations, whereas the current visualization postprocessor can.

Finally, it is worth pointing out the &ldquo;topography&rdquo; postprocessor (not a visualization postprocessor) that returns the surface elevation as a point cloud into a text file. The information is comparable to what the current object creates, but it is not as easily used to visualize information.

Physical units: $\text{m}$.

&lsquo;surface strain rate tensor&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output on the surface of the domain for the 4 (in 2d) or 9 (in 3d) components of the strain rate tensor, i.e., for the components of the tensor $\varepsilon(\mathbf u)$ in the incompressible case and $\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I$ in the compressible case.Note that both in 2d and in 3d the output tensor will have 9 elements, but that in 2d, only 4 are filled.

Physical units: $\frac{1}{\text{s}}$.

&lsquo;surface stress&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output on the surface of the domain for the 3 (in 2d) or 6 (in 3d) components of the stress tensor, i.e., for the components of the tensor $-2\eta\varepsilon(\mathbf u)+pI$ in the incompressible case and $-2\eta\left[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I\right]+pI$ in the compressible case. If elasticity is included, its contribution is accounted for. Note that the convention of positive compressive stress is followed.The stress outputted on the surface of the domain will equal the stress on the surface of the volume output if the parameter &rsquo;Point-wise stress and strain&rsquo; in the Visualization subsection is set to true.

This postprocessor outputs the quantity computed herein as a tensor, i.e., programs such as VisIt or Pararview can visualize it as tensors represented by ellipses, not just as individual fields. That said, you can also visualize individual tensor components, by noting that the components that are written to the output file correspond to the tensor components $t_{xx}, t_{xy}, t_{yx}, t_{yy}$ (in 2d) or  $t_{xx}, t_{xy}, t_{xz}, t_{yx}, t_{yy}, t_{yz}, t_{zx}, t_{zy}, t_{zz}$ (in 3d) of a tensor $t$ in a Cartesian coordinate system. Even though the tensor we output is symmetric, the output contains all components of the tensor because that is what the file format requires.

Physical units: $\text{Pa}$.

&lsquo;temperature anomaly&rsquo;: A visualization output postprocessor that outputs the temperature minus the depth-average of the temperature.The average temperature is calculated using the lateral averaging function from the &ldquo;depth average&rdquo; postprocessor and interpolated linearly between the layers specified through &ldquo;Number of depth slices&rdquo;.

The &rsquo;nonadiabatic temperature&rsquo; is another option to output temperature anomaly, but compared with the reference adiabatic temperature profile instead.Physical units: $\text{K}$.

&lsquo;vertical heat flux&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the heat flux in the vertical direction, which is the sum of the advective and the conductive heat flux, with the sign convention of positive flux upwards.

Physical units: $\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^2}$.

&lsquo;volume of fluid values&rsquo;: A visualization output object that outputs the volume fraction and optionally a level set field and the interface normal vectors of volume of fluid fields.

Physical units: None.

&lsquo;volumetric strain rate&rsquo;: A visualization output object that generates output for the volumetric strain rate, i.e., for the quantity $\nabla\cdot\mathbf u = \textrm{div}\; \mathbf u = \textrm{trace}\; \varepsilon(\mathbf u)$. This should be zero (in some average sense) in incompressible convection models, but can be non-zero in compressible models and models with melt transport.

Physical units: $\frac{1}{\text{s}}$.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Number_20of_20grouped_20files)=
### __Parameter name:__ Number of grouped files
**Default value:** 16

**Pattern:** [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** VTU file output supports grouping files from several CPUs into a given number of files using MPI I/O when writing on a parallel filesystem. Select 0 for no grouping. This will disable parallel file output and instead write one file per processor. A value of 1 will generate one big file containing the whole solution, while a larger value will create that many files (at most as many as there are MPI ranks).

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Output_20base_20variables_20on_20mesh_20surface)=
### __Parameter name:__ Output base variables on mesh surface
**Default value:** false

**Pattern:** [Bool]

**Documentation:** Whether or not to also output the base variables velocity, fluid pressure (when present), fluid velocity (when present), pressure, temperature and compositional fields (when present) on the surface of the mesh. The mesh surface includes not only the top boundary, but all boundaries of the domain.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Output_20format)=
### __Parameter name:__ Output format
**Default value:** vtu

**Pattern:** [Selection none|dx|ucd|gnuplot|povray|eps|gmv|tecplot|vtk|vtu|hdf5|svg|deal.II intermediate|parallel deal.II intermediate ]

**Documentation:** The file format to be used for graphical output. The list of possible output formats that can be given here is documented in the appendix of the manual where the current parameter is described.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Output_20mesh_20displacement)=
### __Parameter name:__ Output mesh displacement
**Default value:** false

**Pattern:** [Bool]

**Documentation:** For computations with deforming meshes, ASPECT uses an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation to handle deforming the domain. The displacement vector from the reference configuration may be written as an output field by setting this parameter to true.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Output_20mesh_20velocity)=
### __Parameter name:__ Output mesh velocity
**Default value:** false

**Pattern:** [Bool]

**Documentation:** For computations with deforming meshes, ASPECT uses an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation to handle deforming the domain, so the mesh has its own velocity field.  This may be written as an output field by setting this parameter to true.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Output_20undeformed_20mesh)=
### __Parameter name:__ Output undeformed mesh
**Default value:** false

**Pattern:** [Bool]

**Documentation:** For computations with deforming meshes, ASPECT uses an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation to handle deforming the domain. By default, we output the deformed mesh. If this setting is set to true, the mesh will be written in the reference state without deformation instead. If you output the mesh displacement, you can obtain the deformed mesh by using the &rsquo;warp by vector&rsquo; ParaView filter.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Point_2dwise_20stress_20and_20strain)=
### __Parameter name:__ Point-wise stress and strain
**Default value:** false

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Temporary_20output_20location)=
### __Parameter name:__ Temporary output location
**Default value:**

**Pattern:** [Anything]

**Documentation:** On large clusters it can be advantageous to first write the output to a temporary file on a local file system and later move this file to a network file system. If this variable is set to a non-empty string it will be interpreted as a temporary storage location.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Time_20between_20graphical_20output)=
### __Parameter name:__ Time between graphical output
**Default value:** 1e8

**Pattern:** [Double 0...MAX_DOUBLE (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** The time interval between each generation of graphical output files. A value of zero indicates that output should be generated in each time step. Units: years if the &rsquo;Use years instead of seconds&rsquo; parameter is set; seconds otherwise.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Time_20steps_20between_20graphical_20output)=

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Write_20higher_20order_20output)=
### __Parameter name:__ Write higher order output
**Default value:** false

**Pattern:** [Bool]

**Documentation:** deal.II offers the possibility to write vtu files with higher order representations of the output data. This means each cell will correctly show the higher order representation of the output data instead of the linear interpolation between vertices that ParaView and VisIt usually show. Note that activating this option is safe and recommended, but requires that (i) &ldquo;Output format&rdquo; is set to &ldquo;vtu&rdquo;, (ii) &ldquo;Interpolate output&rdquo; is set to true, and (iii) you use a sufficiently new version of Paraview or VisIt to read the files (Paraview version 5.5 or newer, and VisIt version to be determined).
The effect of using this option can be seen in the following picture:

\begin{center}  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{viz/parameters/higher-order-output}\end{center}The top figure shows the plain output without interpolation or higher order output. The middle figure shows output that was interpolated as discussed for the &ldquo;Interpolate output&rdquo; option. The bottom panel shows higher order output that achieves better accuracy than the interpolated output at a lower memory cost.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Write_20in_20background_20thread)=
### __Parameter name:__ Write in background thread

Sets are separated from each other by semicolons and vector components within each set are separated by commas (e.g. $vec1_x$, $vec1_y$ ; $vec2_x$, $vec2_y$) where each name must be a defined named compositional field. If only one name is given in a set, it is interpreted as the first in a sequence of dim consecutive compositional fields.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Density_20anomaly)=
## **Subsection:** Postprocess / Visualization / Density anomaly
(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Density_20anomaly/Average_20density_20scheme)=
### __Parameter name:__ Average density scheme
**Default value:** reference profile

**Pattern:** [Selection reference profile|lateral average ]

**Documentation:** Scheme to compute the average density-depth profile. The reference profile option evaluates the conditions along the reference adiabat according to the material model. The lateral average option instead calculates a lateral average from subdivision of the mesh. The lateral average option may produce spurious results where there are sharp density changes.

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Density_20anomaly/Number_20of_20depth_20slices)=
### __Parameter name:__ Number of depth slices
**Default value:** 20

**Pattern:** [Integer range 1...2147483647 (inclusive)]

(parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/Heat_20flux_20map/Output_20point_20wise_20heat_20flux)=
### __Parameter name:__ Output point wise heat flux
**Default value:** false

**Pattern:** [Bool]

**Documentation:** A boolean flag that controls whether to output the heat flux map as a point wise value, or as a cell-wise averaged value. The point wise output is more accurate, but it currently omits prescribed heat flux values at boundaries and advective heat flux that is caused by velocities non-tangential to boundaries. If you do not use these two features it is recommended to switch this setting on to benefit from the increased output resolution.
