**Documentation:** A comma-separated list of initial temperature models that will be used to initialize the temperature. These plugins are loaded in the order given, and modify the existing temperature field via the operators listed in &rsquo;List of model operators&rsquo;.

The following initial temperature models are available:

&lsquo;S40RTS perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following the S20RTS or S40RTS shear wave velocity model by Ritsema and others, which can be downloaded here \url{http://www.earth.lsa.umich.edu/~jritsema/research.html}. Information on the vs model can be found in Ritsema, J., Deuss, A., van Heijst, H.J. \& Woodhouse, J.H., 2011. S40RTS: a degree-40 shear-velocity model for the mantle from new Rayleigh wave dispersion, teleseismic traveltime and normal-mode splitting function measurements, Geophys. J. Int. 184, 1223-1236. The scaling between the shear wave perturbation and the density perturbation can be constant and set by the user with the &rsquo;Vs to density scaling&rsquo; parameter or depth-dependent and read in from a file. To convert density the user can specify the &rsquo;Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling&rsquo; parameter. The scaling is as follows: $\delta \ln \rho (r,\theta,\phi) = \xi \cdot \delta \ln v_s(r,\theta, \phi)$ and $\delta T(r,\theta,\phi) = - \frac{1}{\alpha} \delta \ln \rho(r,\theta,\phi)$. $\xi$ is the &lsquo;vs to density scaling&rsquo; parameter and $\alpha$ is the &rsquo;Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling&rsquo; parameter. The temperature perturbation is added to an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model). If a depth is specified in &rsquo;Remove temperature heterogeneity down to specified depth&rsquo;, there is no temperature perturbation prescribed down to that depth.
Note the required file format if the vs to density scaling is read in from a file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &rsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of points in the reference state as for example &rsquo;# POINTS: 3&rsquo;. Following the comment lines there has to be a single line containing the names of all data columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not allowed to contain spaces. The file can contain unnecessary columns, but for this plugin it needs to at least provide the columns named &lsquo;depth&rsquo; and &lsquo;vs\_to\_density&rsquo;. Note that the data lines in the file need to be sorted in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model domain. Points in the model that are outside of the provided depth range will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of properties is optimized in speed if they are.
If the plugin is used in 2d it will use an equatorial slice of the seismic tomography model.

&lsquo;SAVANI perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following the SAVANI shear wave velocity model by Auer and others, which can be downloaded here \url{http://n.ethz.ch/~auerl/savani.tar.bz2}. Information on the vs model can be found in Auer, L., Boschi, L., Becker, T.W., Nissen-Meyer, T. \& Giardini, D., 2014. Savani: A variable resolution whole-mantle model of anisotropic shear velocity variations based on multiple data sets. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 119.4 (2014): 3006-3034. The scaling between the shear wave perturbation and the density perturbation can be constant and set by the user with the &rsquo;Vs to density scaling&rsquo; parameter or depth-dependent and read in from a file. To convert density the user can specify the &rsquo;Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling&rsquo; parameter. The scaling is as follows: $\delta \ln \rho (r,\theta,\phi) = \xi \cdot \delta \ln v_s(r,\theta, \phi)$ and $\delta T(r,\theta,\phi) = - \frac{1}{\alpha} \delta \ln \rho(r,\theta,\phi)$. $\xi$ is the &lsquo;vs to density scaling&rsquo; parameter and $\alpha$ is the &rsquo;Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling&rsquo; parameter. The temperature perturbation is added to an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).If a depth is specified in &rsquo;Remove temperature heterogeneity down to specified depth&rsquo;, there is no temperature perturbation prescribed down to that depth.
Note the required file format if the vs to density scaling is read in from a file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &rsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of points in the reference state as for example &rsquo;# POINTS: 3&rsquo;. Following the comment lines there has to be a single line containing the names of all data columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not allowed to contain spaces. The file can contain unnecessary columns, but for this plugin it needs to at least provide the columns named &lsquo;depth&rsquo; and &lsquo;vs\_to\_density&rsquo;. Note that the data lines in the file need to be sorted in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model domain. Points in the model that are outside of the provided depth range will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of properties is optimized in speed if they are.

&lsquo;adiabatic&rsquo;: Temperature is prescribed as an adiabatic profile with upper and lower thermal boundary layers, whose ages are given as input parameters. Note that this plugin uses the &rsquo;Adiabatic conditions model&rsquo; to compute the adiabat. Thus, the results depend on variables defined outside of this specific subsection; e.g. the globally defined &rsquo;Adiabatic surface temperature&rsquo;, and the variables defined in the &rsquo;Material model&rsquo; section including densities, heat capacities and thermal expansivities.

&lsquo;adiabatic boundary&rsquo;: An initial temperature condition that allows for discretizing the model domain into two layers separated by a user-defined isothermal boundary. The user includes an input ascii data file that is formatted as 3 columns of &lsquo;longitude(radians)&rsquo;, &lsquo;colatitude(radians)&rsquo;, and &lsquo;isotherm depth(meters)&rsquo;, where &lsquo;isotherm depth&rsquo; represents the depth of an initial temperature of 1673.15 K (by default). The first lines in the data file may contain any number of comments if they begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example &lsquo;# POINTS: 69 121&rsquo;. Note that the coordinates need to be sorted in a specific order: the &lsquo;longitude&rsquo; coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the &lsquo;colatitude&rsquo; coordinate in order to assign the correct data (isotherm depth) to the prescribed coordinates. The temperature is defined from the surface (273.15 K) to the isotherm depth (1673.15 K) as a linear gradient. Below the isotherm depth the temperature increases approximately adiabatically (0.0005 K per meter). This plugin should work for all geometry models, but is currently only tested for spherical models.

&lsquo;ascii data&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example &lsquo;# POINTS: 3 3&rsquo;. The order of the data columns has to be &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo;, &lsquo;Temperature [K]&rsquo; in a 2d model and  &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo;, &lsquo;z&rsquo;, &lsquo;Temperature [K]&rsquo; in a 3d model, which means that there has to be a single column containing the temperature. Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the assumed grid changes. &lsquo;x&rsquo; will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, &lsquo;y&rsquo; by the azimuth angle and &lsquo;z&rsquo; by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, &lsquo;theta&rsquo; and not &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;theta&rsquo;, &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, since this allows for dimension independent expressions.

&lsquo;ascii data layered&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Each file defines a surface on which temperature is defined. Between the surfaces, the temperatures can be chosen to be constant (with a value defined by the nearest shallower surface), or linearly interpolated between surfaces. Note the required format of the input ascii data file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example &lsquo;# POINTS: 3 3&rsquo;. The order of the data columns has to be &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo;, &lsquo;Temperature [K]&rsquo; in a 2d model and &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo;, &lsquo;z&rsquo;, &lsquo;Temperature [K]&rsquo; in a 3d model; i.e. the last two columns always contain the position of the isotherm along the vertical direction, and the temperature at that point. The first column needs to ascend first, followed by the second in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the assumed grid changes. &lsquo;x&rsquo; will be replaced by the azimuth angle and &lsquo;y&rsquo; (if 3d) by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The last column will be the distance of the point from the origin (i.e. radial position). The grid in this case will be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates in 3d is &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, &lsquo;theta&rsquo;, &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;T&rsquo;and not &lsquo;theta&rsquo;, &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;T&rsquo; as this is more consistent with other ASPECT plugins. Outside of the region defined by the grid, the plugin will use the value at the edge of the region.

&lsquo;ascii profile&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is read from a file that provides these values as a function of depth. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of points in the temperature profile, for example &lsquo;# POINTS: 10&rsquo;. Following the comment lines, there has to be a single line containing the names of all data columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not allowed to contain spaces. The file can contain unnecessary columns, but for this plugin it needs to at least provide columns named &lsquo;depth&rsquo; and&lsquo;temperature&rsquo;.Note that the data lines in the file need to be sorted in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model domain. Points in the model that are outside of the provided depth range will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of properties is optimized in speed if they are.

&lsquo;continental geotherm&rsquo;: This is a temperature initial condition that computes a continental geotherm based on the solution of the steady-state conductive equation $k\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2}+\rho H = 0$ as described in e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, Ch. 4.6, or Chapman (1986). As boundary conditions, we take the surface temperature and the temperature of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB).
The geotherm is computed for a homogeneous lithosphere composed of an upper crust, lower crust and mantle layer. The crustal layers are assumed to have a constant radioactive heating, and all layers are assumed to have a constant thermal conductivity. Layer thicknesses, surface temperature and LAB temperature should be specified by the user. For consistency, the density, heat production and thermal conductivity of each layer are read from the visco plastic material model and the compositional heating model.
For any depths below the depth of the LAB, a unrealistically high temperature is returned, such that this plugin can be combined with another temperature plugin through the &rsquo;minimum&rsquo; operator.
Note that the current implementation only works for a 3-layer lithosphere, even though in principle the heat conduction equation can be solved for any number of layers. The naming of the compositional fields that represent the layers is also very specific, namely &lsquo;upper\_crust&rsquo;, &lsquo;lower\_crust&rsquo;, and &lsquo;lithospheric\_mantle&rsquo;.
Make sure the top and bottom temperatures of the lithosphere agree with temperatures set in for example the temperature boundary conditions.

&lsquo;function&rsquo;: Specify the initial temperature in terms of an explicit formula. The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see {ref}`sec:run-aspect:parameters-overview:muparser-format`.

&lsquo;harmonic perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following a harmonic function (spherical harmonic or sine depending on geometry and dimension) in lateral and radial direction from an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).

&lsquo;inclusion shape perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which there is an inclusion in a constant-temperature box field. The size, shape, gradient, position, and temperature of the inclusion are defined by parameters.

&lsquo;lithosphere mask&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is set to a specified lithosphere temperature above the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (specified by an ascii file or maximum lithosphere depth value). Below this the initial temperature is set as NaN.  Note the required format of the input data file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &rsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example &rsquo;# POINTS: 3 3&rsquo;. For a spherical model, the order of the data columns has to be &rsquo;phi&rsquo;, &rsquo;theta&rsquo;, &rsquo;depth (m)&rsquo;, where phi is the azimuth angle and theta is the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. This plug-in can be combined with another using the &rsquo;replace if valid&rsquo; operator.

&lsquo;mandelbox&rsquo;: Fractal-shaped temperature field.

&lsquo;patch on S40RTS&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is derived from a file containing shear wave velocity perturbations in ascii format (e.g. a high resolution upper mantle tomography) combined with S40RTS. Note the required format of the input ascii input data: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &rsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example &rsquo;# POINTS: 3 3 3&rsquo;. The order of the data columns has to be  &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo;, &lsquo;z&rsquo;, &rsquo;Vs Perturbation&rsquo; in a 3d model, which means that there has to be a single column containing the temperature. Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates. In the spherical model data will be handled as Cartesian, however, &lsquo;x&rsquo; will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, &lsquo;y&rsquo; by the azimuth angle and &lsquo;z&rsquo; by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, &lsquo;theta&rsquo; and not &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;theta&rsquo;, &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, since this allows for dimension independent expressions. See S40RTS documentation for details on input parameters in the S40RTS perturbation subsection. The boundary between the two tomography models is smoothed using a depth weighted combination of Vs values within the region of smoothing.

&lsquo;perturbed box&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The perturbation is chosen in such a way that the initial temperature is constant to one along the entire boundary.

&lsquo;polar box&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The perturbation is such that there are two poles on opposing corners of the box.

&lsquo;prescribed temperature&rsquo;: This model fixes the initial temperature to the prescribed temperature outputs computed by the material model. This only works if the material model implements prescribed temperature outputs.

&lsquo;random Gaussian perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed from a temperature of zero following a given number of Gaussian perturbations placed randomly throughout the model domain. The number, width, and maximum magnitude of the perturbations can be chosen as model parameters. This plugin is meant to be used in combination with another initial temperature model that determines the background temperature (such as the &rsquo;function&rsquo; or the &rsquo;adiabatic&rsquo; plugin) using the &rsquo;add&rsquo; operator to combine them.

&lsquo;spherical gaussian perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed by a single Gaussian added to an otherwise spherically symmetric state. Additional parameters are read from the parameter file in subsection &rsquo;Spherical gaussian perturbation&rsquo;.

&lsquo;spherical hexagonal perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following an $N$-fold pattern in a specified direction from an otherwise spherically symmetric state. The class&rsquo;s name comes from previous versions when the only option was $N=6$.

&lsquo;world builder&rsquo;: Specify the initial temperature through the World Builder. More information on the World Builder can be found at \url{https://geodynamicworldbuilder.github.io}. Make sure to specify the location of the World Builder file in the parameter &rsquo;World builder file&rsquo;.

&lsquo;S40RTS perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following the S20RTS or S40RTS shear wave velocity model by Ritsema and others, which can be downloaded here \url{http://www.earth.lsa.umich.edu/~jritsema/research.html}. Information on the vs model can be found in Ritsema, J., Deuss, A., van Heijst, H.J. \& Woodhouse, J.H., 2011. S40RTS: a degree-40 shear-velocity model for the mantle from new Rayleigh wave dispersion, teleseismic traveltime and normal-mode splitting function measurements, Geophys. J. Int. 184, 1223-1236. The scaling between the shear wave perturbation and the density perturbation can be constant and set by the user with the &rsquo;Vs to density scaling&rsquo; parameter or depth-dependent and read in from a file. To convert density the user can specify the &rsquo;Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling&rsquo; parameter. The scaling is as follows: $\delta \ln \rho (r,\theta,\phi) = \xi \cdot \delta \ln v_s(r,\theta, \phi)$ and $\delta T(r,\theta,\phi) = - \frac{1}{\alpha} \delta \ln \rho(r,\theta,\phi)$. $\xi$ is the &lsquo;vs to density scaling&rsquo; parameter and $\alpha$ is the &rsquo;Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling&rsquo; parameter. The temperature perturbation is added to an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model). If a depth is specified in &rsquo;Remove temperature heterogeneity down to specified depth&rsquo;, there is no temperature perturbation prescribed down to that depth.
Note the required file format if the vs to density scaling is read in from a file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &rsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of points in the reference state as for example &rsquo;# POINTS: 3&rsquo;. Following the comment lines there has to be a single line containing the names of all data columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not allowed to contain spaces. The file can contain unnecessary columns, but for this plugin it needs to at least provide the columns named &lsquo;depth&rsquo; and &lsquo;vs\_to\_density&rsquo;. Note that the data lines in the file need to be sorted in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model domain. Points in the model that are outside of the provided depth range will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of properties is optimized in speed if they are.
If the plugin is used in 2d it will use an equatorial slice of the seismic tomography model.

&lsquo;SAVANI perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following the SAVANI shear wave velocity model by Auer and others, which can be downloaded here \url{http://n.ethz.ch/~auerl/savani.tar.bz2}. Information on the vs model can be found in Auer, L., Boschi, L., Becker, T.W., Nissen-Meyer, T. \& Giardini, D., 2014. Savani: A variable resolution whole-mantle model of anisotropic shear velocity variations based on multiple data sets. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 119.4 (2014): 3006-3034. The scaling between the shear wave perturbation and the density perturbation can be constant and set by the user with the &rsquo;Vs to density scaling&rsquo; parameter or depth-dependent and read in from a file. To convert density the user can specify the &rsquo;Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling&rsquo; parameter. The scaling is as follows: $\delta \ln \rho (r,\theta,\phi) = \xi \cdot \delta \ln v_s(r,\theta, \phi)$ and $\delta T(r,\theta,\phi) = - \frac{1}{\alpha} \delta \ln \rho(r,\theta,\phi)$. $\xi$ is the &lsquo;vs to density scaling&rsquo; parameter and $\alpha$ is the &rsquo;Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling&rsquo; parameter. The temperature perturbation is added to an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).If a depth is specified in &rsquo;Remove temperature heterogeneity down to specified depth&rsquo;, there is no temperature perturbation prescribed down to that depth.
Note the required file format if the vs to density scaling is read in from a file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &rsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of points in the reference state as for example &rsquo;# POINTS: 3&rsquo;. Following the comment lines there has to be a single line containing the names of all data columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not allowed to contain spaces.

Note that the data lines in the file need to be sorted in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model domain. Points in the model that are outside of the provided depth range will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of properties is optimized in speed if they are.

&lsquo;adiabatic&rsquo;: Temperature is prescribed as an adiabatic profile with upper and lower thermal boundary layers, whose ages are given as input parameters. Note that this plugin uses the &rsquo;Adiabatic conditions model&rsquo; to compute the adiabat. Thus, the results depend on variables defined outside of this specific subsection; e.g. the globally defined &rsquo;Adiabatic surface temperature&rsquo;, and the variables defined in the &rsquo;Material model&rsquo; section including densities, heat capacities and thermal expansivities.

&lsquo;adiabatic boundary&rsquo;: An initial temperature condition that allows for discretizing the model domain into two layers separated by a user-defined isothermal boundary. The user includes an input ascii data file that is formatted as 3 columns of &lsquo;longitude(radians)&rsquo;, &lsquo;colatitude(radians)&rsquo;, and &lsquo;isotherm depth(meters)&rsquo;, where &lsquo;isotherm depth&rsquo; represents the depth of an initial temperature of 1673.15 K (by default). The first lines in the data file may contain any number of comments if they begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example &lsquo;# POINTS: 69 121&rsquo;. Note that the coordinates need to be sorted in a specific order: the &lsquo;longitude&rsquo; coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the &lsquo;colatitude&rsquo; coordinate in order to assign the correct data (isotherm depth) to the prescribed coordinates. The temperature is defined from the surface (273.15 K) to the isotherm depth (1673.15 K) as a linear gradient. Below the isotherm depth the temperature increases approximately adiabatically (0.0005 K per meter). This plugin should work for all geometry models, but is currently only tested for spherical models.

&lsquo;ascii data&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example &lsquo;# POINTS: 3 3&rsquo;. The order of the data columns has to be &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo;, &lsquo;Temperature [K]&rsquo; in a 2d model and  &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo;, &lsquo;z&rsquo;, &lsquo;Temperature [K]&rsquo; in a 3d model, which means that there has to be a single column containing the temperature. Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the assumed grid changes. &lsquo;x&rsquo; will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, &lsquo;y&rsquo; by the azimuth angle and &lsquo;z&rsquo; by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, &lsquo;theta&rsquo; and not &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;theta&rsquo;, &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, since this allows for dimension independent expressions.

&lsquo;ascii data layered&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Each file defines a surface on which temperature is defined. Between the surfaces, the temperatures can be chosen to be constant (with a value defined by the nearest shallower surface), or linearly interpolated between surfaces. Note the required format of the input ascii data file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example &lsquo;# POINTS: 3 3&rsquo;. The order of the data columns has to be &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo;, &lsquo;Temperature [K]&rsquo; in a 2d model and &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo;, &lsquo;z&rsquo;, &lsquo;Temperature [K]&rsquo; in a 3d model; i.e. the last two columns always contain the position of the isotherm along the vertical direction, and the temperature at that point. The first column needs to ascend first, followed by the second in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the assumed grid changes. &lsquo;x&rsquo; will be replaced by the azimuth angle and &lsquo;y&rsquo; (if 3d) by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The last column will be the distance of the point from the origin (i.e. radial position). The grid in this case will be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates in 3d is &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, &lsquo;theta&rsquo;, &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;T&rsquo;and not &lsquo;theta&rsquo;, &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;T&rsquo; as this is more consistent with other ASPECT plugins. Outside of the region defined by the grid, the plugin will use the value at the edge of the region.

&lsquo;ascii profile&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is read from a file that provides these values as a function of depth. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of points in the temperature profile, for example &lsquo;# POINTS: 10&rsquo;. Following the comment lines, there has to be a single line containing the names of all data columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not allowed to contain spaces. The file can contain unnecessary columns, but for this plugin it needs to at least provide columns named &lsquo;depth&rsquo; and&lsquo;temperature&rsquo;.Note that the data lines in the file need to be sorted in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model domain. Points in the model that are outside of the provided depth range will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of properties is optimized in speed if they are.

&lsquo;continental geotherm&rsquo;: This is a temperature initial condition that computes a continental geotherm based on the solution of the steady-state conductive equation $k\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2}+\rho H = 0$ as described in e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, Ch. 4.6, or Chapman (1986). As boundary conditions, we take the surface temperature and the temperature of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB).
The geotherm is computed for a homogeneous lithosphere composed of an upper crust, lower crust and mantle layer. The crustal layers are assumed to have a constant radioactive heating, and all layers are assumed to have a constant thermal conductivity. Layer thicknesses, surface temperature and LAB temperature should be specified by the user. For consistency, the density, heat production and thermal conductivity of each layer are read from the visco plastic material model and the compositional heating model.
For any depths below the depth of the LAB, a unrealistically high temperature is returned, such that this plugin can be combined with another temperature plugin through the &rsquo;minimum&rsquo; operator.
Note that the current implementation only works for a 3-layer lithosphere, even though in principle the heat conduction equation can be solved for any number of layers. The naming of the compositional fields that represent the layers is also very specific, namely &lsquo;upper\_crust&rsquo;, &lsquo;lower\_crust&rsquo;, and &lsquo;lithospheric\_mantle&rsquo;.
Make sure the top and bottom temperatures of the lithosphere agree with temperatures set in for example the temperature boundary conditions.

&lsquo;function&rsquo;: Specify the initial temperature in terms of an explicit formula. The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see {ref}`sec:run-aspect:parameters-overview:muparser-format`.

&lsquo;harmonic perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following a harmonic function (spherical harmonic or sine depending on geometry and dimension) in lateral and radial direction from an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).

&lsquo;inclusion shape perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which there is an inclusion in a constant-temperature box field. The size, shape, gradient, position, and temperature of the inclusion are defined by parameters.

&lsquo;lithosphere mask&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is set to a specified lithosphere temperature above the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (specified by an ascii file or maximum lithosphere depth value). Below this the initial temperature is set as NaN.  Note the required format of the input data file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &rsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example &rsquo;# POINTS: 3 3&rsquo;. For a spherical model, the order of the data columns has to be &rsquo;phi&rsquo;, &rsquo;theta&rsquo;, &rsquo;depth (m)&rsquo;, where phi is the azimuth angle and theta is the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. This plug-in can be combined with another using the &rsquo;replace if valid&rsquo; operator.

&lsquo;mandelbox&rsquo;: Fractal-shaped temperature field.

&lsquo;patch on S40RTS&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is derived from a file containing shear wave velocity perturbations in ascii format (e.g. a high resolution upper mantle tomography) combined with S40RTS. Note the required format of the input ascii input data: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &rsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example &rsquo;# POINTS: 3 3 3&rsquo;. The order of the data columns has to be  &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo;, &lsquo;z&rsquo;, &rsquo;Vs Perturbation&rsquo; in a 3d model, which means that there has to be a single column containing the temperature. Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates. In the spherical model data will be handled as Cartesian, however, &lsquo;x&rsquo; will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, &lsquo;y&rsquo; by the azimuth angle and &lsquo;z&rsquo; by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, &lsquo;theta&rsquo; and not &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;theta&rsquo;, &lsquo;phi&rsquo;, since this allows for dimension independent expressions. See S40RTS documentation for details on input parameters in the S40RTS perturbation subsection. The boundary between the two tomography models is smoothed using a depth weighted combination of Vs values within the region of smoothing.

&lsquo;perturbed box&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The perturbation is chosen in such a way that the initial temperature is constant to one along the entire boundary.

&lsquo;polar box&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The perturbation is such that there are two poles on opposing corners of the box.

&lsquo;prescribed temperature&rsquo;: This model fixes the initial temperature to the prescribed temperature outputs computed by the material model. This only works if the material model implements prescribed temperature outputs.

&lsquo;random Gaussian perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed from a temperature of zero following a given number of Gaussian perturbations placed randomly throughout the model domain. The number, width, and maximum magnitude of the perturbations can be chosen as model parameters. This plugin is meant to be used in combination with another initial temperature model that determines the background temperature (such as the &rsquo;function&rsquo; or the &rsquo;adiabatic&rsquo; plugin) using the &rsquo;add&rsquo; operator to combine them.

&lsquo;spherical gaussian perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed by a single Gaussian added to an otherwise spherically symmetric state. Additional parameters are read from the parameter file in subsection &rsquo;Spherical gaussian perturbation&rsquo;.

&lsquo;spherical hexagonal perturbation&rsquo;: An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following an $N$-fold pattern in a specified direction from an otherwise spherically symmetric state. The class&rsquo;s name comes from previous versions when the only option was $N=6$.

&lsquo;world builder&rsquo;: Specify the initial temperature through the World Builder. More information on the World Builder can be found at \url{https://geodynamicworldbuilder.github.io}. Make sure to specify the location of the World Builder file in the parameter &rsquo;World builder file&rsquo;.

**Warning**: This parameter provides an old and deprecated way of specifying initial temperature models and shouldn&rsquo;t be used. Please use &rsquo;List of model names&rsquo; instead.

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to &lsquo;r,phi,theta,t&rsquo; and then use these variable names in your function expression.
