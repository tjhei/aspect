# Particles 2


## **Subsection:** Particles 2


(parameters:Particles_202/Allow_20cells_20without_20particles)=
### __Parameter name:__ Allow cells without particles
**Default value:** false

**Pattern:** [Bool]

**Documentation:** By default, every cell needs to contain particles to use this interpolator plugin. If this parameter is set to true, cells are allowed to have no particles. In case both the current cell and its neighbors are empty, the interpolator will return 0 for the current cell&rsquo;s properties.

(parameters:Particles_202/Integration_20scheme)=
### __Parameter name:__ Integration scheme
**Default value:** rk2

**Pattern:** [Selection euler|rk2|rk4 ]

**Documentation:** This parameter is used to decide which method to use to solve the equation that describes the position of particles, i.e., $\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf x_k(t) = \mathbf u(\mathbf x_k(t),t)$, where $k$ is an index that runs over all particles, and $\mathbf u(\mathbf x,t)$ is the velocity field that results from the Stokes equations.

In practice, the exact velocity $\mathbf u(\mathbf x,t)$ is of course not available, but only a numerical approximation $\mathbf u_h(\mathbf x,t)$. Furthermore, this approximation is only available at discrete time steps, $\mathbf u^n(\mathbf x)=\mathbf u(\mathbf x,t^n)$, and these need to be interpolated between time steps if the integrator for the equation above requires an evaluation at time points between the discrete time steps. If we denote this interpolation in time by $\tilde{\mathbf u}_h(\mathbf x,t)$ where $\tilde{\mathbf u}_h(\mathbf x,t^n)=\mathbf u^n(\mathbf x)$, then the equation the differential equation solver really tries to solve is $\frac{d}{dt}\tilde{\mathbf x}_k(t) =  \tilde{\mathbf u}_h(\mathbf x_k(t),t)$.

As a consequence of these considerations, if you try to assess convergence properties of an ODE integrator -- for example to verify that the RK4 integrator converges with fourth order --, it is important to recall that the integrator may not solve the equation you think it solves. If, for example, we call the numerical solution of the ODE $\tilde{\mathbf x}_{k,h}(t)$, then the error will typically satisfy a relationship like \[  \| \tilde{\mathbf x}_k(T) - \tilde{\mathbf x}_{k,h}(T) \|  \le  C(T) \Delta t^p\] where $\Delta t$ is the time step and $p$ the convergence order of the method, and $C(T)$ is a (generally unknown) constant that depends on the end time $T$ at which one compares the solutions. On the other hand, an analytically computed trajectory would likely use the *exact* velocity, and one may be tempted to compute $\| \mathbf x_k(T) - \tilde{\mathbf x}_{k,h}(T) \|$, but this quantity will, in the best case, only satisfy an estimate of the form \[  \| \mathbf x_k(T) - \tilde{\mathbf x}_{k,h}(T) \|  \le  C_1(T) \Delta t^p  + C_2(T) \| \mathbf u-\mathbf u_h \|  + C_3(T) \| \mathbf u_h-\tilde{\mathbf u}_h \|\] with appropriately chosen norms for the second and third term. These second and third terms typically converge to zero at relatively low rates (compared to the order $p$ of the integrator, which can often be chosen relatively high) in the mesh size $h$ and the time step size $\\Delta t$, limiting the overall accuracy of the ODE integrator.

Select one of the following models:

&lsquo;euler&rsquo;: Explicit Euler scheme integrator, where $y_{n+1} = y_n + \Delta t \, v(y_n)$. This requires only one integration substep per timestep.

&lsquo;rk2&rsquo;: Second Order Runge Kutta integrator $y_{n+1} = y_n + \Delta t\, v(t_{n+1/2}, y_{n} + \frac{1}{2} k_1)$ where $k_1 = \Delta t\, v(t_{n}, y_{n})$

&lsquo;rk4&rsquo;: Runge Kutta fourth order integrator, where $y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{1}{6} k_1 + \frac{1}{3} k_2 + \frac{1}{3} k_3 + \frac{1}{6} k_4$ and $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$, $k_4$ are defined as usual.

### __Parameter name:__ Interpolation scheme
**Default value:** cell average

**Pattern:** [Selection bilinear least squares|cell average|distance weighted average|harmonic average|nearest neighbor|quadratic least squares ]

**Documentation:** Select one of the following models:

&lsquo;bilinear least squares&rsquo;: Uses linear least squares to obtain the slopes and center of a 2d or 3d plane from the particle positions and a particular property value on those particles. Interpolate this property onto a vector of points. If the limiter is enabled then it will ensure the interpolated properties do not exceed the range of the minimum and maximum of the values of the property on the particles. Note that deal.II must be configured with BLAS and LAPACK to support this operation.

&lsquo;cell average&rsquo;: Return the arithmetic average of all particle properties in the given cell, or in the neighboring cells if the given cell is empty. In case the neighboring cells are also empty, and &rsquo;Allow cells without particles&rsquo; is set to true, the interpolator returns 0. Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

&lsquo;distance weighted average&rsquo;: Interpolates particle properties onto a vector of points using a distance weighed averaging method.

&lsquo;harmonic average&rsquo;: Return the harmonic average of all particle properties in the given cell. If the cell contains no particles, return the harmonic average of the properties in the neighboring cells. In case the neighboring cells are also empty, and &rsquo;Allow cells without particles&rsquo; is set to true, the interpolator returns 0. Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

&lsquo;nearest neighbor&rsquo;: Return the properties of the nearest neighboring particle in the current cell, or nearest particle in nearest neighboring cell if current cell is empty. In case the neighboring cells are also empty, and &rsquo;Allow cells without particles&rsquo; is set to true, the interpolator returns 0. Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

&lsquo;quadratic least squares&rsquo;: Interpolates particle properties onto a vector of points using a quadratic least squares method. Note that deal.II must be configured with BLAS/LAPACK.

### __Parameter name:__ List of particle properties
**Default value:**

**Pattern:** [MultipleSelection composition|composition reaction|cpo bingham average|cpo elastic tensor|crust and lithosphere formation|crystal preferred orientation|elastic stress|elastic tensor decomposition|function|grain size|initial composition|initial position|integrated strain|integrated strain invariant|melt particle|pT path|position|reference position|strain rate|velocity|velocity gradient|viscoplastic strain invariants ]

**Documentation:** A comma separated list of particle properties that should be tracked. By default none is selected, which means only position, velocity and id of the particles are output.

The following properties are available:

&lsquo;composition&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is defined by the compositional fields in the model. This can be used to track solid compositionevolution over time.

&lsquo;composition reaction&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is given as the initial composition at the particle&rsquo;s initial position, and is updated during the simulation time according to reactions that are specified as functions in the input file. Each reaction has exactly one reactant and one product. Each particle gets as many properties as there are compositional fields. The reactions are described by two functions, and the change in each composition at the time a reaction occurs is computed as the product of the two functions. The &rsquo;Reaction area function&rsquo; describes the area where the reaction takes place. It can be spatially variable, but does not depend on time. The &rsquo;Reaction rate function&rsquo; describes how the change in composition depends on these compositions themselves and on time. To use this particle property for a given compositional field, set the &rsquo;Mapped particle properties&rsquo; to &rsquo;name_of_field:name_of_field reaction&rsquo;, i.e., the name of the particle property for each field is the name of the compositional field with the word &rsquo;reaction&rsquo; added at the end.

&lsquo;cpo bingham average&rsquo;: This is a particle property plugin which computes the Bingham average for the Crystal Preferred Orientation particle property plugin so that it can be visualized.

&lsquo;cpo elastic tensor&rsquo;: A plugin in which the particle property tensor is defined as the Voigt average of the elastic tensors of the minerals in the textured rock.Currently only Olivine and Enstatite are supported.

&lsquo;crust and lithosphere formation&rsquo;: A plugin in which the particle property is defined as the evolving chemical composition that results from the formation of oceanic crust and lithosphere as mantle material approaches the surface and melts. Note that this does not necessarily conserves the bulk chemical composition of the mantle, since the conversion only depends on the mantle flow. See the crust and lithosphere formation reaction model documentation for more detailed information.

&lsquo;crystal preferred orientation&rsquo;: WARNING: all the CPO plugins are a work in progress and not ready for production use yet. See https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/issues/3885 for current status and alternatives. The plugin manages and computes the evolution of Lattice/Crystal Preferred Orientations (LPO/CPO) on particles. Each ASPECT particle can be assigned many grains. Each grain is assigned a size and a orientation matrix. This allows for CPO evolution tracking with polycrystalline kinematic CrystalPreferredOrientation evolution models such as D-Rex (Kaminski and Ribe, 2001; Kaminski et al., 2004).

&lsquo;elastic stress&rsquo;: A plugin in which the particle property tensor is defined as the total elastic stress a particle has accumulated. This plugin modifies the properties with the name ve_stress_*. It first applies the stress change resulting from system evolution during the previous computational timestep, and then the rotation of those stresses into the current timestep. See the viscoelastic or visco_plastic material model documentation for more detailed information.

&lsquo;elastic tensor decomposition&rsquo;: A plugin which decomposes the elastic tensor into different approximations (Isotropic, Hexagonal, Tetragonal, Orthorhombic, Monoclinic and Triclinic) and provides the eigenvectors of the tensor.

&lsquo;function&rsquo;: Implementation of a model in which the particle property is set by evaluating an explicit function at the initial position of each particle. The function is defined in the parameters in section &ldquo;Particles|Function&rdquo;. The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see {ref}`sec:run-aspect:parameters-overview:muparser-format`.

&lsquo;grain size&rsquo;: A plugin in which the particle property is defined as the evolving grain size of a particle. See the grain_size material model documentation for more detailed information.

&lsquo;initial composition&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is given as the initial composition at the particle&rsquo;s initial position. The particle gets as many properties as there are compositional fields.

&lsquo;initial position&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is given as the initial position of the particle. This property is vector-valued with as many components as there are space dimensions. In practice, it is often most useful to only visualize one of the components of this vector, or the magnitude of the vector. For example, in a spherical mantle simulation, the magnitude of this property equals the starting radius of a particle, and is thereby indicative of which part of the mantle a particle comes from.

&lsquo;integrated strain&rsquo;: A plugin in which the particle property tensor is defined as the deformation gradient tensor $\mathbf F$ this particle has experienced. $\mathbf F$ can be polar-decomposed into the left stretching tensor $\mathbf L$ (the finite strain we are interested in), and the rotation tensor $\mathbf Q$. See the corresponding cookbook in the manual for more detailed information.

&lsquo;integrated strain invariant&rsquo;: A plugin in which the particle property is defined as the finite strain invariant ($\varepsilon_{ii}$). This property is calculated with the timestep ($dt$) and the second invariant of the deviatoric strain rate tensor ($\dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}$), where the value at time step $n$ is $\varepsilon_{ii}^{n} = \varepsilon_{ii}^{n-1} + dt\dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}$.

&lsquo;melt particle&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is defined as presence of melt above a threshold, which can be set as an input parameter. This property is set to 0 if melt is not present and set to 1 if melt is present.

&lsquo;pT path&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is defined as the current pressure and temperature at this position. This can be used to generate pressure-temperature paths of material points over time.

&lsquo;position&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is defined as the current position.

&lsquo;reference position&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is defined as the current reference position.

&lsquo;strain rate&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the time evolution of strain rate is saved and stored on the particles.

&lsquo;velocity&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is defined as the recent velocity at this position.

&lsquo;velocity gradient&rsquo;: Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is defined as the recent velocity gradient at this position.

&lsquo;viscoplastic strain invariants&rsquo;: A plugin that calculates the finite strain invariant a particle has experienced and assigns it to either the plastic and/or viscous strain field based on whether the material is plastically yielding, or the total strain field used in the visco plastic material model. The implementation of this property is equivalent to the implementation for compositional fields that is located in the plugin in `benchmarks/buiter\_et\_al\_2008\_jgr/plugin/`,and is effectively the same as what the visco plastic material model uses for compositional fields.

**Documentation:** Upper limit for particle number per cell. This limit is useful for adaptive meshes to prevent coarse cells from slowing down the whole model. It will be checked and enforced after mesh refinement, after MPI transfer of particles and after particle movement. If there are `n\_number\_of\_particles` $>$ `max\_particles\_per\_cell` particles in one cell then `n\_number\_of\_particles` - `max\_particles\_per\_cell` particles in this cell are randomly chosen and destroyed.

### __Parameter name:__ Minimum particles per cell

**Pattern:** [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** Lower limit for particle number per cell. This limit is useful for adaptive meshes to prevent fine cells from being empty of particles. It will be checked and enforced after mesh refinement and after particle movement. If there are `n\_number\_of\_particles` $<$ `min\_particles\_per\_cell` particles in one cell then `min\_particles\_per\_cell` - `n\_number\_of\_particles` particles are generated and randomly placed in this cell. If the particles carry properties the individual property plugins control how the properties of the new particles are initialized.

### __Parameter name:__ Particle generator name
**Default value:** random uniform

**Pattern:** [Selection ascii file|probability density function|quadrature points|random uniform|reference cell|uniform box|uniform radial ]

**Documentation:** Select one of the following models:

&lsquo;ascii file&rsquo;: Generates a distribution of particles from coordinates specified in an Ascii data file. The file format is a simple text file, with as many columns as spatial dimensions and as many lines as particles to be generated. Initial comment lines starting with &lsquo;#&rsquo; will be discarded. Note that this plugin always generates as many particles as there are coordinates in the data file, the &ldquo;Particles/Number of particles&rdquo; parameter has no effect on this plugin. All of the values that define this generator are read from a section &ldquo;Particles/Generator/Ascii file&rdquo; in the input file, see {ref}`parameters:Particles/Generator/Ascii_20file`.

&lsquo;probability density function&rsquo;: Generate a random distribution of particles over the entire simulation domain. The probability density is prescribed in the form of a user-prescribed function. The format of this function follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see {ref}`sec:run-aspect:parameters-overview:muparser-format`. The return value of the function is always checked to be a non-negative probability density but it can be zero in parts of the domain.

&lsquo;quadrature points&rsquo;: Generates particles at the quadrature points of each active cell of the triangulation. Here, Gauss quadrature of degree (velocity\_degree + 1), is used similarly to the assembly of Stokes matrix.

&lsquo;random uniform&rsquo;: Generates a random uniform distribution of particles over the entire simulation domain. This generator can be understood as the special case of the &rsquo;probability density function&rsquo; generator where the probability density is constant over the domain.

&lsquo;reference cell&rsquo;: Generates a uniform distribution of particles per cell and spatial direction in the unit cell and transforms each of the particles back to real region in the model domain. Uniform here means the particles will be generated with an equal spacing in each spatial dimension.

&lsquo;uniform box&rsquo;: Generate a uniform distribution of particles over a rectangular domain in 2d or 3d. Uniform here means the particles will be generated with an equal spacing in each spatial dimension. Note that in order to produce a regular distribution the number of generated particles might not exactly match the one specified in the input file.

&lsquo;uniform radial&rsquo;: Generate a uniform distribution of particles over a spherical domain in 2d or 3d. Uniform here means the particles will be generated with an equal spacing in each spherical spatial dimension, i.e., the particles are created at positions that increase linearly with equal spacing in radius, colatitude and longitude around a certain center point. Note that in order to produce a regular distribution the number of generated particles might not exactly match the one specified in the input file.

(parameters:Particles_202/Particle_20weight)=
### __Parameter name:__ Particle weight
**Default value:** 10

**Pattern:** [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** Weight that is associated with the computational load of a single particle. The sum of particle weights will be added to the sum of cell weights to determine the partitioning of the mesh if the &lsquo;repartition&rsquo; particle load balancing strategy is selected. The optimal weight depends on the used integrator and particle properties. In general for a more expensive integrator and more expensive properties a larger particle weight is recommended. Before adding the weights of particles, each cell already carries a weight of 1000 to account for the cost of field-based computations.

(parameters:Particles_202/Update_20ghost_20particles)=
### __Parameter name:__ Update ghost particles
**Default value:** true

**Pattern:** [Bool]

**Documentation:** Some particle interpolation algorithms require knowledge about particles in neighboring cells. To allow this, particles in ghost cells need to be exchanged between the processes neighboring this cell. This parameter determines whether this transport is happening. This parameter is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Ghost particle updates are always performed. Please set the parameter to &lsquo;true&rsquo;.

These values can be defined using this parameter, in the form &lsquo;var1=value1, var2=value2, ...&rsquo;.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to &lsquo;pi=3.1415926536&rsquo; and then use &lsquo;pi&rsquo; in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both &lsquo;pi&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pi&rsquo; by default, but you get the idea.)

(parameters:Particles_202/Composition_20reaction/Reaction_20area_20function/Function_20expression)=
### __Parameter name:__ Function expression
**Default value:** 0

**Pattern:** [Anything]

In addition, it may contain expressions like &lsquo;if(x>0, 1, -1)&rsquo; where the expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is true, and to the third argument otherwise. For a full overview of possible expressions accepted see the documentation of the muparser library at http://muparser.beltoforion.de/.

### __Parameter name:__ Variable names
**Default value:** x,y,t

**Pattern:** [Anything]

**Documentation:** The names of the variables as they will be used in the function, separated by commas.

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to &lsquo;r,phi,theta,t&rsquo; and then use these variable names in your function expression.

Instead of spatial coordinates, the inputs for this function represent the value of the &lsquo;reactant&rsquo; and &lsquo;product&rsquo; compositions so that the value of the current composition can be used to calculate the change due to the reaction. Additionally, &lsquo;t&rsquo; represents the time. You can use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated.

These values can be defined using this parameter, in the form &lsquo;var1=value1, var2=value2, ...&rsquo;.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to &lsquo;pi=3.1415926536&rsquo; and then use &lsquo;pi&rsquo; in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both &lsquo;pi&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pi&rsquo; by default, but you get the idea.)

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to &lsquo;r,phi,theta,t&rsquo; and then use these variable names in your function expression.

For a full overview of possible expressions accepted see the documentation of the muparser library at http://muparser.beltoforion.de/.
