About
-----

ASPECT is a code to simulate convection and tectonic processes in
Earth and other planetary bodies. It has grown from a pure
mantle-convection code into a tool for many geodynamic applications
including applications for inner core convection, lithospheric scale
deformation, two-phase flow, and numerical methods development. The
project is supported by CIG (https://geodynamics.org).


Installation instructions
-------------------------

The steps to install the necessary dependencies and ASPECT itself are described
in the Installation instructions section of the ASPECT
[manual](https://aspect-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install/index.html). If you encounter
problems during the installation, please consult our
[wiki](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/wiki) for typical installation
problems or specific instructions for MacOS users, before asking your question
on the forum.

In short, ASPECT is configured using CMake and has the following requirements:
- CMake 3.13.4
- GCC, Clang, or Intel compiler with C++14 support
- [deal.II](https://github.com/dealii/dealii) 9.5.0 or newer configured with:
  - MPI, Trilinos, p4est, SUNDIALS (required)
  - BLAS/LAPACK, zlib (strongly recommended)
  - HDF5 (optional)
- optional: PerpleX, LIBDAP, NETCDF

Running and extending ASPECT
----------------------------

Instructions on how to run and extend, as well as on how to interpret the
output of ASPECT can also be found in the ASPECT
[manual](https://aspect-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). This manual also
discusses the structure of the source code.

For getting started, you can also watch recordings from our
[tutorials](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/wiki/Tutorial-Materials).


Contributing to ASPECT
----------------------

ASPECT is a community project that lives by the participation of its
members â€” i.e., including you! It is our goal to build an inclusive
and participatory community so we are happy that you are interested in
participating! We have collected a set of guidelines and advice on how
to get involved in the community and keep them in the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
file in ASPECT's repository.
